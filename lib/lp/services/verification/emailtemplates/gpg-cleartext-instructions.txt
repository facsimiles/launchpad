This message contains the instructions for confirming registration of an
OpenPGP key for use in Launchpad.  The confirmation instructions have been
encrypted with the OpenPGP key you have attempted to register.  If you cannot
read the unencrypted instructions below, it may be because your mail reader
does not support automatic decryption of "ASCII armored" encrypted text.

Exact instructions for enabling this depends on the specific mail reader you
are using.  Please visit the OpenPGP website for more information:
